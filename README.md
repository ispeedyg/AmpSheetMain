Going to make this a Public folder so I can get some help along the way. 

Pasting notes from a word document. 

Building the front page

Inputs are:
Ask if you need to create top page But how to get popup screen. To ask? Turtle tkinter?
Make this sheet the first sheet.
Then on subsequent sheets is the 12,24,36,48
Then how to get the individual cells of each
How to make python know the path to the workbook with clicking on the workbook in finder
Add a total watts number to the front page that will calculate
When the number of channels is totally complete running the python for the workbook.

Do you have more that 5 channels on any given circuit?
If yes how many is the max channels on 1 circuit?
Is there any channel ranges in a 100 series different Wattages?
Then pull from sheet 0 thru 99 = Watts
All the way to 1000 â€“ 1099. 
You need to find out here if when python grabs these for the within if the zero is within or is it 1. 
Also need to find out the row.max of the column that has these numbers for a variable in the 

Then to figure out how to keep track or maybe just make an OOP of a 12, 24, 36, 48 way but have to figure out how to use classes to get the numbers and calculate the numbers.
